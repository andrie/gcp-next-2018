## About the data

Activity Recognition from Single Chest-Mounted Accelerometer Data Set

[Source
data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+from+Single+Chest-Mounted+Accelerometer)

### Source:

Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participantes
performing 7 activities. The dataset provides challenges for
identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.

### Data Set Information:

  - The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on
    the chest
  - Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz
  - Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated
  - Number of Participants: 15
  - Number of Activities: 7
  - Data Format: CSV

### Attribute Information:

  - Data are separated by participant
  - Each file contains the following information
      - sequential number
      - x acceleration
      - y acceleration
      - z acceleration
      - label
  - Labels are codified by numbers 1: Working at Computer 2: Standing
    Up, Walking and Going updown stairs 3: Standing 4: Walking 5: Going
    UpDown Stairs 6: Walking and Talking with Someone 7: Talking while
    Standing

## Data preparation

The data was pre-processed by Mango Solutions for their [keras
workshop](http://github.com/mangothecat/keras-workshop) at eRum 2018:

  - The raw data is in long format with a running label on person ID and
    activity ID.
  - We broke it into overlapping chunks and filtered for walking-only
    chunks of 5 seconds.
  - We did some center-scaling but only within chunks
