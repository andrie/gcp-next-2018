## About the data

Activity Recognition from Single Chest-Mounted Accelerometer Data Set

[Source data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+from+Single+Chest-Mounted+Accelerometer)

### Source:

Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participantes performing 7 activities. The dataset provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.


### Data Set Information:

* The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest 
* Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz 
* Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated 
* Number of Participants: 15 
* Number of Activities: 7 
* Data Format: CSV


### Attribute Information:

* Data are separated by participant 
* Each file contains the following information 
  - sequential number
  - x acceleration
  - y acceleration
  - z acceleration
  - label 
* Labels are codified by numbers 
  1: Working at Computer 
  2: Standing Up, Walking and Going updown stairs 
  3: Standing 
  4: Walking 
  5: Going UpDown Stairs 
  6: Walking and Talking with Someone 
  7: Talking while Standing

## Data preparation

The data was pre-processed by Mango Solutions for their [keras workshop](http://github.com/mangothecat/keras-workshop) at eRum 2018:

* The raw data is in long format with a running label on person ID and activity ID.
* We broke it into overlapping chunks and filtered for walking-only chunks of 5 seconds.
* We did some center-scaling but only within chunks

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
x_walk <- readRDS("data/x_walk.rds")
x_walk$train[1, 1:5, ]
frame <- as.data.frame(x_walk$train[1, , ])
frame$time <- 1:260
tidy_frame <- gather(frame, acc, value, -time)
str(tidy_frame)
ggplot(tidy_frame, aes(time, value)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(~acc)
```
